       "      <td>Stayed here for a few nights on a random getaway my boyfriend planned. The hotel itself was very nice  with a more modern look to it, Should mention that we stayed on the 53rd floor. Would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for HOUSEKEEPING GOING THROUGH MY PURSE. I don't like to bash on businesses but I'm someone who reads reviews to help make a decision on things and I would want to know what to beware of. I had left my purse zipped close on one of the bottom shelves of the desk right before we went out to come back after housekeeping was in to find it fully unzipped spread open. As you can imagine I was furious with this and called the hotel to notify them. Security came up and took a report and I received a call a day after we checked out from hotel management. They took $115 off what we payed but at the end of the day I don't think I will ever visit that hotel again. What's $115 to knowing someone has gone through your personal belongings while you were out. Very unfortunate that one person can make such a negative impact. I really hope they follow up with that issue so that it doesn't happen to anyone else. \\nThe only other thing that was wrong there was that every time after the shower was used the whole restroom would smell bad. Pretty sure it had something to do with their drains but it almost smelt like sewage or vomit. Without those two issues I really would have given it 5 stars.</td>\n",

       "0  Ken and Debra are amazing real estate agents!  I know that there are so many real estate agents here in AZ, but I can't recommend Ken and Debra enough.  I had been taken advantage of by an agent a number of years ago, and I was hesitant to go through the process again. Actually terrified was more like it. This time couldn't be more different. Ken and Debra were there for us every step of the way.  The most important thing was that they listened to us throughout the process.  No question was too insignificant.  They were incredibly helpful making sure that all of our concerns were addressed, and if there were questions that we didn't know to ask, they made sure we got answers to those questions as well.  I really felt like they had our best interests in mind, and I never felt we were left in the dark.  I really felt like we were working with friends!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "4  Stayed here for a few nights on a random getaway my boyfriend planned. The hotel itself was very nice  with a more modern look to it, Should mention that we stayed on the 53rd floor. Would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for HOUSEKEEPING GOING THROUGH MY PURSE. I don't like to bash on businesses but I'm someone who reads reviews to help make a decision on things and I would want to know what to beware of. I had left my purse zipped close on one of the bottom shelves of the desk right before we went out to come back after housekeeping was in to find it fully unzipped spread open. As you can imagine I was furious with this and called the hotel to notify them. Security came up and took a report and I received a call a day after we checked out from hotel management. They took $115 off what we payed but at the end of the day I don't think I will ever visit that hotel again. What's $115 to knowing someone has gone through your personal belongings while you were out. Very unfortunate that one person can make such a negative impact. I really hope they follow up with that issue so that it doesn't happen to anyone else. \\nThe only other thing that was wrong there was that every time after the shower was used the whole restroom would smell bad. Pretty sure it had something to do with their drains but it almost smelt like sewage or vomit. Without those two issues I really would have given it 5 stars.   \n",

I came to this place for the first time due to a Groupon. 2 tickets, popcorn, and 2 beers for $21. The price is unbeatable and I will agree that it is an amazing deal. \\n\\nThe reason this place gets three stars is because it is still a great place to come and so far has been the best Dine-In Movie theater in Arizona I have visited, but the service here is truly lacking. Our drinks took much longer than an acceptable time to arrive. I had to press my call button to check on my drinks before they finally brought them. Server didn't really check on us unless we pressed the call button. I would've ordered more had they checked in. \\n\\nThe Roadtrip for two is supposed to come with two \"fully loaded quesadillas\" but what we truly got was about a half of a quesadilla to share. I understand it's happy hour, but at least be more transparent so that people know what to expect when they order. \\n\\nThe White Cheddar popcorn was a huge bowl of popcorn, I was pleased with it. \\n\\nThe restroom was decent, one out of order urinal but the urine cakes smelled like they hadn't been replaced in some time.  \\n\\nOverall, I will be coming back and will be recommending this place, but I hope management sees the large room for improvement here in the service of the wait staff. This place has a big potential to be five stars if their staff is held to a higher standard.</td>\n",

       "274  As a new resident in Mesa, I couldn't believe that there weren't more carwashes around in my immediate area off of McKellips and Recker.  I then did a search on Google to find a good car wash and found Francis and Son's Car Wash on Main Street off Higley. \\n\\nThey take their time and do it right. It's been cleaned perfectly...friendly and happy employees,  which makes me happy. Since it's a new car for me, I was very picky about how it was done and was very pleased and continue to frequent their car wash.

       "18   Our dining experience was generally poor.  There were few people in the restaurant, and yet it took a very long time to take our drink orders, get our food, and bring our check.  Service was relatively slow given the buffet-style setting.\\n\\nI was part of a group of four, and we all selected fried rice for our rice option, however, when our dishes were served we all found chunks of white rice in our bowls.  The roti bread felt stiff and dry, and several of our bowls had bits of ingredients that weren't personally added.  Overall, these issues make the dining experience unpleasant in general.\\n\\nHowever, in addition, the food is over-priced at $16/bowl (plus $2 if you want to take your leftovers home).  I never thought I'd say this, but if you're in the mood for make-your-own stir-fry?  Go to Flat Top, in Campustown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "461  Roadhouse Cinemas is a slightly better Studio Movie Grill. With a western theme that is slightly tacky and almost looks like it wasn't given a full effort. I came to this place for the first time due to a Groupon. 2 tickets, popcorn, and 2 beers for $21. The price is unbeatable and I will agree that it is an amazing deal. \\n\\nThe reason this place gets three stars is because it is still a great place to come and so far has been the best Dine-In Movie theater in Arizona I have visited, but the service here is truly lacking. Our drinks took much longer than an acceptable time to arrive. I had to press my call button to check on my drinks before they finally brought them. Server didn't really check on us unless we pressed the call button. I would've ordered more had they checked in. \\n\\nThe Roadtrip for two is supposed to come with two \"fully loaded quesadillas\" but what we truly got was about a half of a quesadilla to share. I understand it's happy hour, but at least be more transparent so that people know what to expect when they order. \\n\\nThe White Cheddar popcorn was a huge bowl of popcorn, I was pleased with it. \\n\\nThe restroom was decent, one out of order urinal but the urine cakes smelled like they hadn't been replaced in some time.  \\n\\nOverall, I will be coming back and will be recommending this place, but I hope management sees the large room for improvement here in the service of the wait staff. This place has a big potential to be five stars if their staff is held to a higher standard.   \n",

       "461  roadhouse cinemas is a slightly better studio movie grill with a western theme that is slightly tacky and almost looks like it wasnt given a full effort i came to this place for the first time due to a groupon 2 tickets popcorn and 2 beers for 21 the price is unbeatable and i will agree that it is an amazing deal \\n\\nthe reason this place gets three stars is because it is still a great place to come and so far has been the best dinein movie theater in arizona i have visited but the service here is truly lacking our drinks took much longer than an acceptable time to arrive i had to press my call button to check on my drinks before they finally brought them server didnt really check on us unless we pressed the call button i wouldve ordered more had they checked in \\n\\nthe roadtrip for two is supposed to come with two fully loaded quesadillas but what we truly got was about a half of a quesadilla to share i understand its happy hour but at least be more transparent so that people know what to expect when they order \\n\\nthe white cheddar popcorn was a huge bowl of popcorn i was pleased with it \\n\\nthe restroom was decent one out of order urinal but the urine cakes smelled like they hadnt been replaced in some time  \\n\\noverall i will be coming back and will be recommending this place but i hope management sees the large room for improvement here in the service of the wait staff this place has a big potential to be five stars if their staff is held to a higher standard   \n",

    "* First 1D CNN layer: The first layer defines a filter (or also called feature detector) of height 10 (also called kernel size). Only defining one filter would allow the neural network to learn one single feature in the first layer. This might not be sufficient, therefore we will define 100 filters. This allows us to train 100 different features on the first layer of the network. The output of the first neural network layer is a 71 x 100 neuron matrix. Each column of the output matrix holds the weights of one single filter. With the defined kernel size and considering the length of the input matrix, each filter will contain 71 weights.\n",
    "* Second 1D CNN layer: The result from the first CNN will be fed into the second CNN layer. We will again define 100 different filters to be trained on this level. Following the same logic as the first layer, the output matrix will be of size 62 x 100.\n",
    "* Max pooling layer: A pooling layer is often used after a CNN layer in order to reduce the complexity of the output and prevent overfitting of the data. In our example we chose a size of three. This means that the size of the output matrix of this layer is only a third of the input matrix.\n",
    "* Third and fourth 1D CNN layer: Another sequence of 1D CNN layers follows in order to learn higher level features. The output matrix after those two layers is a 2 x 160 matrix.\n",
    "* Average pooling layer: One more pooling layer to further avoid overfitting. This time not the maximum value is taken but instead the average value of two weights within the neural network. The output matrix has a size of 1 x 160 neurons. Per feature detector there is only one weight remaining in the neural network on this layer.\n",
    "* Dropout layer: The dropout layer will randomly assign 0 weights to the neurons in the network. Since we chose a rate of 0.5, 50% of the neurons will receive a zero weight. With this operation, the network becomes less sensitive to react to smaller variations in the data. Therefore it should further increase our accuracy on unseen data. The output of this layer is still a 1 x 160 matrix of neurons.\n",
    "* Fully connected layer with Softmax activation: The final layer will reduce the vector of height 160 to a vector of six since we have six classes that we want to predict (“Jogging”, “Sitting”, “Walking”, “Standing”, “Upstairs”, “Downstairs”). This reduction is done by another matrix multiplication. Softmax is used as the activation function. It forces all six outputs of the neural network to sum up to one. The output value will therefore represent the probability for each of the six classes.\n",
